COMMIT: MatrixSwarm – Unified Sentinel Trust Model & Autonomous Matrix Recovery

Date: 2026-01-22
Important: Reinstall scripts/matrixd after updating MatrixOS.
Note: Only one Sentinel should be configured as Matrix’s watcher (universal_id_under_watch). Multiple watchers are unnecessary under the new trust model.

Overview

This update modernizes and simplifies MatrixSwarm’s identity propagation model. Verified Sentinels no longer require chained ancestry to inherit Matrix’s trust keys.

Any agent with:

"matrix_secure_verified": true


is automatically issued full Matrix credentials during the initialization sweep.

This yields a more resilient, self-healing swarm with significantly reduced operational complexity.

Key Changes
1. Unified Identity Assignment

All propagation logic has been consolidated into:

TreeParser.assign_identity_to_all_nodes()


This function:

Identifies the Matrix root

Identifies all verified Sentinels

Assigns each Sentinel:

Matrix’s private key

Matrix’s public key

Matrix’s swarm AES key

A shallow copy of the Matrix node (metadata only, no children)

A verification timestamp

This ensures direct, deterministic credential delivery without dependency on intermediate nodes.

2. New Helper: get_node_shallow()

Sentinels now store a cleaned Matrix header:

Contains Matrix metadata

Excludes all children

Prevents recursive inheritance

Reduces JSON size and memory footprint

This header is used during Matrix respawn to instantly reestablish trust.

3. Sentinel Chains No Longer Required

Historically, Sentinels had to be arranged in a chain (parent → child → child) because credentials were relayed through ancestry.

Under the new system:

One Sentinel is sufficient.

Still, for optimized survivability and aesthetics, operators may choose to locate a Sentinel at the extremity of a multi-agent chain:

agent-1 → agent-2 → sentinel-fa9e9b


Benefits:

Harder to destroy the full trust backbone

Failure requires eliminating Matrix and all chain layers and the Sentinel

CPU footprint remains negligible

Visually iconic graph layout

Deployment Notes

Reinstall matrixd after pulling this update — runtime expects the new trust model.

Marking a single agent with "matrix_secure_verified": true now guarantees Matrix resurrection capability.

Chains remain supported but optional.

Extra Sentinels can be removed to simplify topology.

Performance remains optimal: ~0.03ms per node during identity sweep.

Closing Statement

“In every collapse lies a blueprint for resurrection.
The Swarm survives because the Swarm remembers.”
