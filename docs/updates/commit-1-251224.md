• Added new ThreadLauncher process manager
• Oracle service mixins and class library refinements
• Maintenance across matrix, oracle, storm_crow, and related agents
• Phoenix UI enhancement: Swarm Graph constructor for visual swarm building
• General cleanup and dependency alignment

(which integrates TrendScout, MetaBlast, and CDN_Dozer),

Note: ensure your Phoenix instance is updated to use
the new Swarm Graph builder when constructing swarms.
