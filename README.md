# MatrixOS  
(from the MatrixSwarm ecosystem)

MatrixOS is the **multi-language swarm runtime** of the MatrixSwarm ecosystem.  
Agents run side-by-side â€” not under you â€” operating through file-based communication.

- Written in Python with Go and Rust agents in development.  
- Encrypted, resurrectable, and fully decentralized.  
- Every agent is signed, sandboxed, and resurrected if killed.

## Remote Control & Security Notice

**The official GUI for remote control, deployment, and monitoring of MatrixSwarm universes.**

If you want to operate MatrixSwarm securely over the Internet, you **must** use [Phoenix Cockpit](https://github.com/matrixswarm/phoenix).

- All remote commands, status, and logs are encrypted, signed, and relayed through the Phoenix cockpit using the `matrix_https` and `websocket-relay` agents.
- No agent is exposed via open HTTP/S, and no API is available without a signed packet, trusted client certificate, and the Queen's signature.
- **Without Phoenix, the Matrix Queen does not listen!**

To connect and control a MatrixSwarm universe from anywhere, always run the cockpit:

pip install -e . # in your Phoenix repo
phoenix # launches the secure GUI

Get Phoenix Cockpit here:
ðŸ‘‰ See: [Phoenix Cockpit](https://github.com/matrixswarm/phoenix)

### Why canâ€™t you just open MatrixOS to the net?

- Direct agent communication is not exposed over HTTP/S by design (security: no untrusted RPC, no raw file bus).

- Only Phoenix can sign, encrypt, and relay operator commands via the trusted HTTPS/WS agents.

Running MatrixOS headless without Phoenix? Only use on private networks â€” or youâ€™re not protected!

## Matrix Boot Process Overview
When matrixd boot --universe <name> is called, MatrixOS enters a multi-phase lifecycle:

1. Directive Decryption
Loads an encrypted directive file from /matrix/boot_directives/<universe>.enc.json

Uses the paired swarm key /matrix/boot_directives/keys/<universe>.key

Decrypts via AES-GCM and parses into a full agent hierarchy using the TreeParser.

2. Tree Parsing & Identity Assignment
The TreeParser walks the JSON structure, rejecting malformed or duplicate agents.

Each node is assigned a signed identity token using Matrixâ€™s RSA private key.

Agents receive a vault.json with their universal_id, AES key, and RSA keypair.

3. Agent Matching (Code Resolution)
Each agent node specifies a name and lang. Example:

````json
  { "name": "sentinel", "lang": "python", "universal_id": "guardian-1" }
````

CoreSpawner resolves this to /matrix/agents/-lang-/-name-.-ext-

Example: sentinel + python â†’ /agents/python/sentinel.py

If src_embed is present, base64 source is used instead of disk.

4. Ghost Vault Encryption
Before spawn, a vault is encrypted with AES and injected via environment (VAULTFILE, SYMKEY).

Agent decrypts its runtime payload using ghost_vault.py.

5. BootAgent Runtime Load
All agents descend from BootAgent, which:

Decrypts its vault and loads config

Sets up packet encryption and trust checks

Launches background threads: packet_listener, worker, spawn_manager, directive_watcher

Loads its directive slice from /comm/<agent>/directive/agent_tree.json

Spawns children as defined in the parsed slice

6. Packet Communication (No APIs)
Agents communicate via JSON packets on the filesystem (not HTTP):

incoming/ â†’ receives command packets

payload/ â†’ larger data drops

stack/, queue/, broadcast/ â†’ mission chaining & swarm comms
All files can be encrypted, signed, and verified.

7. The Tree Viewer (TreeParser)
Agents introspect their scoped agent_tree.json to:

Fetch children by role

Find service-managers

Navigate universal_id relationships

Reject malformed/duplicate agents mid-flight

ðŸ—‚ Boot Architecture: Dual Paths â€” Runtime + Static
Every universe boots into two parallel tracks:

Runtime Universe (/matrix/universes/runtime/<universe>/)
Purpose: Speed, volatility, performance

Can be mounted as tmpfs for in-memory execution

Structure:

comm/ â†’ JSON, .cmd, payloads

pod/ â†’ live cloned agents

Symlinked: runtime/<universe>/latest â†’ <uuid>

Volatile and resettable

Static Universe (/matrix/universes/static/<universe>/)
Purpose: Durability, audit, debugging

Structure mirrors runtime:

comm/ â†’ archived comm logs

pod/ â†’ preserved agents + vaults

Archived by UUID for traceability

Symlinked: static/<universe>/latest â†’ <uuid>

Example boot:

````bash
  matrixd boot --universe phoenix
````

âž¡ Creates both runtime and static paths for the session.

### Phoenix GUI
Create directives visually (with embedded certs + signing keys).

Generate from templates, push to /matrix/boot_directives/.

Drag and drop agents into universes.

One click â†’ MatrixOS boots them into life.

### Directives & Keys
Encrypted directive: /matrix/boot_directives/<universe>.enc.json

Matching swarm key: /matrix/boot_directives/keys/<universe>.key (chmod 600)

Auto-resolved at boot (CLI â†’ ENV â†’ key file).

When booted, Matrix loads into /comm/matrix/directive/agent_tree.json.
From there:

Matrix spawns children

Children spawn theirs

The swarm grows, slice by slice

### Core Concepts
Philosophy: MatrixSwarm is a living hierarchy where agents think, die, and come back.

File-Driven: Coordination via .json + .cmd files in comm dirs.

Resurrection: Silent agents are resurrected/replaced by parents.

Filesystem Hierarchy:

/agent â†’ agent source code

/pod â†’ runtime clones (UUIDs)

/comm â†’ communication bus (can be tmpfs)

### Architecture
Matrix (root agent): The queen, signs identities, delegates slices.

BootAgent: Base class â€” lifecycle, crypto, spawning.

Comm bus: /matrix/universes/<uid>/comm (tmpfs).

Pod sandboxes: /matrix/universes/<uid>/pod/<uuid>.

Agents self-heal and hot-reload (die token removal).

ðŸ›  Install matrixd as a System Daemon
Install the executable:

````bash
  sudo cp scripts/matrixd /usr/local/bin/matrixd
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/matrixd
matrixd --help
Install the service:

sudo cp scripts/matrixd.service /etc/systemd/system/matrixd.service
Enable & start:

sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable matrixd
sudo systemctl start matrixd
systemctl status matrixd
Test service:
matrixd list
````
Expected: running agents list or [LIST] No active swarm agents found.


### Auto-boot a universe:
  Edit /etc/systemd/system/matrixd.service:

````ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/matrixd boot --universe phoenix
Reload + restart:
````

```` bash
  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart matrixd
````
